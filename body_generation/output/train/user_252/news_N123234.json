It may delve into McVay's previous successes and how they have diminished, potentially attributing this downturn to Goff's struggles on the field. The article is likely to provide insights on team dynamics, coaching decisions, and the implications for both McVay and Goff's futures with the Rams. Additionally, it could explore the broader context of the NFL landscape and what this means for the team's playoff aspirations.",

  "generated_body": "The article about the three infant deaths at a hospital linked to tainted donor breast milk is likely to discuss the circumstances surrounding these tragic incidents, including details about the hospital's protocols for handling donor milk and the potential health risks associated with contaminated supplies. It may also explore the investigations following the deaths and any responses from health authorities or the hospital administration. Additionally, the piece could provide background on the importance of safety standards in donor milk programs and may highlight the implications for parents relying on such resources for their infants’ nutrition.",

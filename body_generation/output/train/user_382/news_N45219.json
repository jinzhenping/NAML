  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the concerning statistic that a significant portion of Americans have personal experiences with the consequences of healthcare affordability, specifically noting that 13% claim to know someone who has died due to financial barriers to accessing medical care. It may explore the broader implications of this issue, including how healthcare costs impact various demographics and the ongoing debates surrounding healthcare reform in the United States. Additionally, the piece could provide anecdotal evidence or examples that illustrate the real-life consequences of inadequate healthcare access.",

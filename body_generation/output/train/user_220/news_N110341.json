  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the Supreme Court's consideration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects around 700,000 young immigrants from deportation. Readers may expect an overview of the legal arguments presented by both supporters and opponents of DACA, along with insights into potential implications for the affected individuals and broader immigration policy. It could also outline the historical context of DACA and the significance of the Supreme Court’s decision, which may shape the future for many young immigrants in the United States.",

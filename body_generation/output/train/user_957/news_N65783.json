  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the life and legacy of Bob Norris, famously known as the Marlboro Man, who recently passed away at the age of 90. It may cover his role in shaping the iconic Marlboro advertising campaign and how he, paradoxically, was not a smoker himself. The piece could explore his impact on tobacco marketing and societal perceptions of smoking, along with reflections from family, friends, and perhaps insights into his personal life. Readers may find a blend of biographical details and commentary on the cultural significance of his image in advertising.",

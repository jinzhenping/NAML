  "generated_body": "In the article titled \"Republicans are throwing Giuliani under the bus. But there's a problem,\" the user may expect to read about the shifting dynamics within the Republican Party regarding Rudy Giuliani's standing amidst ongoing controversies. The piece is likely to outline how party members are distancing themselves from him, potentially due to his legal troubles or public perception. Additionally, it may discuss the implications of this shift on party unity and future electoral strategies, suggesting that while some Republicans may want to distance themselves, they may face challenges in fully disavowing his influence and legacy.",

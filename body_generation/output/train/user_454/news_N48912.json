  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Is retirement dying? The old work model is disappearing for Boomers, Gen Xers\" is likely to explore the evolving landscape of retirement and employment, particularly focusing on the shifting expectations among Baby Boomers and Generation X. Readers may expect discussions on how traditional retirement models are being challenged by economic factors and changing workforce dynamics, including the rise of gig work and delayed retirement. It could also address the implications of these changes on financial planning and societal attitudes towards aging in the workforce.

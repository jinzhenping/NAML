Readers may expect to learn about Norris's background, including his work as a model for the Marlboro brand, and how he became synonymous with the rugged, masculine image that defined the campaign. The piece could also explore the irony of his association with smoking, considering that he reportedly never smoked himself, and may touch on his later life and personal reflections.",

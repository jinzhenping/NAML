  "generated_body": "In this article, the user is likely to find an analysis of Meghan Markle's recent behavior and public engagements, particularly focusing on her body language as interpreted by an expert. The piece may explore how her actions reflect a desire to distance herself from the public eye, possibly in response to ongoing scrutiny from the media and public opinion. It could also discuss the implications of this disconnection for her public persona and future appearances, although these interpretations are speculative and may vary based on different viewpoints.",

  "generated_body": "The article titled \"No, Not Everyone Is Beautiful, And We'd All Be Better Off If We Stopped Saying We Are\" may explore the concept of beauty standards and societal expectations surrounding appearance. It likely discusses the implications of promoting an unrealistic notion of beauty, possibly drawing on psychological or sociological insights. The piece could also examine the cultural pressures that lead to the affirmation of universal beauty, suggesting that a more nuanced conversation around individual differences may benefit society. Readers might expect an analytical perspective on how these views affect self-esteem and social interactions.",

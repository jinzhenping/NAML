  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the recent claims made by a former FDA adviser regarding LASIK eye surgery, suggesting that it should be removed from the market due to safety concerns. Readers can expect an analysis of the potential risks associated with the procedure, including complications and long-term effects, as well as insights into the regulatory landscape surrounding LASIK. The piece may also explore the implications of such a recommendation for patients considering the surgery, as well as the broader medical community's response to these assertions.",

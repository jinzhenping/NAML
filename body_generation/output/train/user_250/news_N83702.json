  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the current state of the U.S. oil industry, focusing on how fracking companies are preparing to reduce their operations, which may contribute to a slowdown in oil production growth. It could outline the factors influencing this decision, such as market conditions or regulatory changes, and provide insight into how these shifts might affect overall oil supply and pricing in the U.S. The piece may also speculate on potential consequences for energy consumers and the broader economy as production levels adjust.",

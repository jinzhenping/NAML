  "generated_body": "The article is likely to discuss the current state of former President Donald Trump's involvement in the impeachment process, particularly in relation to the first public hearing. It may outline the White House's stance on his activities, potentially emphasizing that he is engaged in work rather than following the proceedings closely. The piece could provide insights into the implications of his absence from the hearing, as well as reactions from political analysts or commentators. Overall, readers can expect a balanced overview of the situation and its significance in the ongoing political landscape.",

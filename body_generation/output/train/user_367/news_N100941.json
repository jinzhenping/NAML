  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Boomers Want to Stay Home. Senior Housing Now Faces a Budding Glut\" is likely to discuss the increasing trend of older adults preferring to age in place rather than move to traditional senior living facilities. It may explore the implications of this preference on the housing market, particularly highlighting a potential oversupply of senior housing options that could arise as demand shifts.

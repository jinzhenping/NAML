  "generated_body": "The article is likely to discuss a recent decision by the Faroe Islands to limit access to the islands, allowing only 100 volunteers to visit. Readers may expect to find details about the reasons behind this restriction, such as environmental concerns or efforts to manage tourism. The piece could also provide information about what being a volunteer entails, including potential roles and responsibilities, as well as the application process for those interested in participating. Additionally, the article may touch on the broader implications of such measures for tourism and conservation in the region.",

  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses recent concerns raised by a former FDA adviser regarding LASIK eye surgery, suggesting that it may need to be reconsidered or potentially removed from the market due to safety or efficacy issues. Readers can expect to find an overview of the adviser's arguments, possibly including statistics or case studies related to complications or adverse effects associated with the procedure. The article may also explore the implications of such a recommendation for patients considering LASIK and the broader impact on the eye surgery industry, although specific details on those outcomes are uncertain.",

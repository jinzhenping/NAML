  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Climate change could end mortgages as we know them\" is likely to discuss the potential impacts of climate change on the housing market and mortgage lending practices. It may explore how increasing environmental risks, such as flooding and wildfires, could affect property values and insurance rates, ultimately leading lenders to reconsider their criteria for mortgage approvals. The piece may also examine broader economic implications, including shifts in housing demand and regional disparities in mortgage access, though these aspects may remain speculative.",

  "generated_body": "The article may provide an overview of the annual incidence of the plague, detailing how between 1,000 to 2,000 cases are reported globally each year, with approximately seven cases occurring in the United States. It could explore the historical context of the disease, its transmission methods, and potential symptoms, as well as preventive measures that can be taken to avoid infection.

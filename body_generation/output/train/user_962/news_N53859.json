Then I Got Pregnant With My Son,\" they are likely expecting to read a personal narrative that explores the author's shifting perspectives on gender and relationships, particularly in the context of motherhood. The article may discuss the author’s previous feelings and beliefs about men, possibly highlighting societal influences or personal experiences that shaped those views. It could also reflect on how becoming a parent, especially to a son, has changed her outlook, prompting her to reconsider her previous attitudes.

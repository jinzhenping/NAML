  "generated_body": "The article about Vanna White hosting \"Wheel of Fortune\" following Pat Sajak's surgery is likely to discuss the circumstances surrounding Sajak's health and the transition of hosting duties. Readers may expect to learn about White's experience and how she has prepared for this temporary role, including any changes to the show's format during Sajak's absence. Additionally, the piece might explore audience reactions to White stepping in, as well as any notable moments from the episodes she hosts. It is likely that the article could also touch on the history between White and Sajak, providing context for their long-standing partnership on the show.",

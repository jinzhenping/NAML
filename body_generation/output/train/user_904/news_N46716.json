  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Cannabis Use Disorder is Rising in U.S. States Where Weed is Legal\" is likely to explore the increasing prevalence of cannabis use disorder in states that have legalized marijuana. Readers may expect an examination of data and statistics that illustrate this trend, as well as insights into the potential causes behind the rise, such as increased access and changing social attitudes toward cannabis use. The piece could also discuss implications for public health and policy, though it may not definitively conclude on the long-term effects of legalization on addiction rates.",

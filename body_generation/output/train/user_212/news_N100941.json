  "generated_body": "In the article titled \"Boomers Want to Stay Home. Senior Housing Now Faces a Budding Glut,\" the user can expect an exploration of the current trends in senior housing, particularly as baby boomers express a preference for aging in place rather than moving to assisted living facilities.

  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Supermassive black hole ejects star from Milky Way Galaxy\" is likely to explore recent astronomical findings regarding the dynamics of supermassive black holes and their interactions with stars. It may provide insights into how a star can be ejected from the Milky Way due to the gravitational influence of a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center.

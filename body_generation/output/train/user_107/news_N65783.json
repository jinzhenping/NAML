  "generated_body": "The article about Marlboro Man Bob Norris, who has passed away at the age of 90, is likely to explore his life and career, particularly his role in the iconic cigarette advertising campaign that positioned him as a symbol of masculinity and ruggedness. The piece may detail Norris's background, including his early life and how he became associated with the Marlboro brand, as well as the irony of him reportedly never having been a smoker himself. Additionally, it could discuss the impact of his image on tobacco advertising and public perception of smoking over the decades.",

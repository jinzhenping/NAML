  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Boomers Want to Stay Home. Senior Housing Now Faces a Budding Glut\" is likely to explore the current trends in senior housing, particularly focusing on the preferences of the baby boomer generation. It may discuss how many older adults prefer to age in place rather than move into assisted living or retirement communities, leading to an oversupply of housing designed for seniors. The piece could also analyze the implications of this shift for real estate markets and developers, as well as the potential challenges in meeting the evolving needs of this demographic.",

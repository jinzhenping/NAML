  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Women in Japan were told not to wear glasses to work. Their response has been fiery\" is likely to explore the recent controversy surrounding workplace norms in Japan, particularly regarding the expectations placed on women and their appearance. It may detail the reactions from women who feel that such mandates are outdated and discriminatory, highlighting the broader implications for gender equality in the workplace. The article could also include personal anecdotes or social media responses that reflect a growing push against traditional gender roles, though the exact nature of these responses is uncertain.",

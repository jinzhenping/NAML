  "generated_body": "In this article, the reader is likely to find an informative discussion about the common misconception that one can contract the flu from the flu shot, emphasizing that this is not the case. It may explain that while the vaccine contains inactivated viruses or pieces of the virus, it cannot cause the disease. The article is also expected to address the potential side effects of the flu shot, which could include mild reactions such as soreness at the injection site or low-grade fever, helping to clarify what individuals might experience after vaccination.",

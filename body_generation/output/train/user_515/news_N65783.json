  "generated_body": "In the article about the passing of Marlboro Man Bob Norris at the age of 90, the user may expect to learn about his life and career, particularly his role as a prominent figure in tobacco advertising. The piece is likely to explore his connection to the iconic Marlboro brand, including details about how he became the face of the campaign and the public perception of his image as a rugged outdoorsman. Additionally, it may touch on his personal choices regarding smoking, as reports suggest he never actually smoked, which could lead to discussions about the impact of advertising on public health and perceptions of masculinity.",

  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses recent developments concerning Oregon's legal framework regarding immigration enforcement, specifically how new limits on courthouse arrests may face challenges from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It may outline the context behind these limits, including the state's efforts to protect individuals seeking legal assistance from immigration actions.

  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses Netflix's decision to modify its documentary \"The Devil Next Door\" in response to feedback from the Polish Prime Minister. Readers can expect an overview of the specific concerns raised by the Polish government, which may revolve around historical representations or cultural sensitivities depicted in the film. The piece could also explore the broader implications of this decision on documentary filmmaking, particularly how political pressures can influence content. Additionally, insights into Netflix's approach to navigating such controversies may be included, though this is uncertain.",

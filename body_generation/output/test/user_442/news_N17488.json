  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses Iran's recent decision to implement rationing measures for ultra-cheap petrol, which may stem from economic pressures and attempts to manage limited resources. It could detail the implications of these measures on the general population, including how rationing might affect daily life and fuel accessibility. Additionally, the article may explore the government's rationale behind this decision, possible public reactions, and the broader context of Iran's economic situation, including sanctions and energy policies.",

  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the recent incident involving Mason Rudolph, who was struck in the head with his own helmet during a game. It may analyze the implications of this event on public perception and accountability in football, particularly regarding player safety and the reactions to such incidents. The piece could also explore why some commentators believe Rudolph is not receiving enough criticism for his role in the situation, potentially examining the broader context of player conduct and media narratives in the sport.",

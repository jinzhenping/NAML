It may detail the ongoing support they are receiving from family, friends, and community resources, as well as any challenges they face in returning to normalcy. The piece could also touch on the broader implications for school safety and mental health awareness in the aftermath of such incidents, although these themes may be explored more generally rather than in-depth.",

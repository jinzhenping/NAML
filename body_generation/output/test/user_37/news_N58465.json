  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Supporting your adult children can ruin your retirement plans\" is likely to explore the financial implications of providing ongoing support to adult children. Readers may expect to find insights into how such assistance can impact savings and retirement goals, possibly discussing the balance between familial obligations and personal financial security. It could also highlight case studies or expert opinions on the long-term effects of these choices. Additionally, the article may offer strategies for maintaining financial independence while still being supportive, but this is uncertain and would depend on the author's approach.",

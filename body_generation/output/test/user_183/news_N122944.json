  "generated_body": "The article is likely to explore the reasons behind McDonald's decision to keep the Filet-O-Fish on its menu, despite fluctuating consumer preferences for other items. It may discuss the history of the sandwich, its sales performance during specific times of the year, and consumer demographics that favor seafood options.

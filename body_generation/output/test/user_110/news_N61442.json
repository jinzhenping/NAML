  "generated_body": "The article titled \"Ukraine 'invisible' as impeachment hearings focus on Washington drama\" is likely to explore the current political climate surrounding the impeachment hearings in the United States, particularly how these proceedings may overshadow critical issues related to Ukraine. Readers may expect an analysis of the implications for U.S.-Ukraine relations and how the focus on domestic political drama could impact international perceptions and assistance. It may also discuss the broader context of Ukraine's situation, suggesting that the ongoing geopolitical tensions might be overlooked amidst the impeachment developments.",

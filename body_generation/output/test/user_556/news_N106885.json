  "generated_body": "The article likely discusses the potential challenges Oregon may face regarding new limits placed on courthouse arrests by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). It may outline the specific provisions of these new limits and how they aim to protect individuals from immigration enforcement in sensitive areas. Additionally, the piece could explore the legal and political implications of these measures, including responses from local law enforcement and advocacy groups. The article may also speculate on the broader impact these changes could have on immigrant communities in Oregon.",
